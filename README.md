# OHRQoL-Trajectory-1
Predicting group-based trajectories of Oral Health-Related Quality of Life using K-means clustering algorithm
---

### ABSTRACT ###

Objectives:
This study aimed to identify and analyze the longitudinal trajectories of Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) from late adolescence to early adulthood using an unsupervised machine learning approach, K-means for Longitudinal data (KmL). 
We hypothesized the existence of distinct OHRQoL trajectory groups with varying slopes over time.

Methods:
This study utilized data from the Iowa Fluoride Study, a prospective cohort study assessing oral health outcomes. 
OHRQoL was measured at ages 17, 19, and 23 using three validated instruments: the Child Perception Questionnaire (CPQ), Global Oral Health Rating (GOHR), and Visual Analog Rating of Quality of Life (VisQoL). 
KmL, an unsupervised clustering algorithm, was applied to identify trajectory groups based on OHRQoL scores. 
The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Calinski-Harabasz criterion. 
Sociodemographic predictors of trajectory group membership were assessed using logistic regression.

Results:
Two distinct OHRQoL trajectories were identified for each measure: a “Good” trajectory group and a “Poor” trajectory group. 
For CPQ, 84.8% of participants belonged to the “Good” trajectory, while 15.2% followed a “Poor” trajectory. 
GOHR trajectories had 57.2% in the “Good” group and 42.8% in the “Poor” group. 
VisQoL trajectories showed 67.5% in the “Good” group and 32.5% in the “Poor” group. 
Higher socioeconomic status was significantly associated with better OHRQoL trajectories (p < 0.05), while sex differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05).

Conclusion:
Machine learning effectively identified distinct OHRQoL trajectories, emphasizing the role of socioeconomic factors in oral health disparities. Future research should explore predictive modeling to enhance personalized oral healthcare strategies.
